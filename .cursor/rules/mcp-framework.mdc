We are in the mcp-framework , a typescript framework that allows construction of model context protocol (mcp) servers.
We are implementing the new specification:
<specification>Overview 
MCP provides a standardized way for applications to:

Share contextual information with language models
Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems
Build composable integrations and workflows
The protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages to establish communication between:

Hosts: LLM applications that initiate connections
Clients: Connectors within the host application
Servers: Services that provide context and capabilities
MCP takes some inspiration from the Language Server Protocol, which standardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of development tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.

Key Details 
Base Protocol 
JSON-RPC message format
Stateful connections
Server and client capability negotiation
Features 
Servers offer any of the following features to clients:

Resources: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use
Prompts: Templated messages and workflows for users
Tools: Functions for the AI model to execute</specification>
